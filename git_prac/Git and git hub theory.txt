Git:
What is Git? Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) designed to track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously, facilitating collaboration and maintaining a history of changes.
Key Concepts:
1.	Repository (Repo): A Git repository is a collection of files and the version history of those files. It can be local (on your computer) or remote (on a server).
2.	Commit: A commit is a snapshot of the changes made to the files in the repository at a specific point in time. It represents a single, atomic change.
3.	Branch: Git uses branches to isolate work. Each branch can be seen as a separate line of development, allowing changes to be made without affecting the main codebase until they are ready to be merged.
4.	Merge: Merging combines changes from different branches. It's a way to incorporate changes from one branch into another.
5.	Pull Request: In the context of Git repositories hosted on platforms like GitHub, a pull request is a way to propose changes to a repository. It allows contributors to submit their changes and request that they be merged into the main branch.

GitHub:
What is GitHub? GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers collaboration features such as bug tracking, task management, and wikis. GitHub allows developers to host their Git repositories and provides additional tools for collaboration.
Key Features:
1.	Repositories: GitHub hosts Git repositories, making it easy to share code with others.
2.	Issues: Developers can create, discuss, and track issues related to code changes.
3.	Pull Requests: Contributors can propose changes to a repository, and maintainers can review and merge those changes.
4.	Actions: GitHub Actions automate workflows, allowing you to build, test, and deploy your code directly from GitHub.
5.	Wikis: Repositories can have wikis for documentation.
6.	Projects: GitHub Projects help manage tasks, track progress, and organize work.
Git and GitHub are related tools, but they serve different purposes in the context of version control and collaboration in software development.
Git:
1.	Definition:
•	Git is a version control system (VCS): It's a tool that manages and tracks changes in source code during software development. It's distributed, meaning that every developer has a complete copy of the code and its history.
2.	Functionality:
•	Local: Git operates locally on a developer's machine. It allows users to track changes, create branches, commit snapshots, and merge code—all within their local environment.
3.	Use Cases:
•	Individual Development: Git is essential for individual developers to track changes and manage versions of their code.
•	Collaboration: Developers can share their local repositories with others, facilitating collaboration.
4.	Commands:
•	Git commands are used in the command line interface (CLI) to perform version control tasks locally.
GitHub:
1.	Definition:
•	GitHub is a web-based platform: It provides hosting for software development projects that use Git for version control. GitHub adds a collaborative layer on top of Git by offering features for team collaboration, issue tracking, and project management.
2.	Functionality:
•	Remote Hosting: GitHub is a remote repository hosting service. It allows users to store their Git repositories on GitHub's servers, making it accessible to others.
•	Collaboration Tools: GitHub offers features like pull requests, issues, project boards, wikis, etc., to facilitate collaboration among developers.
3.	Use Cases:
•	Team Collaboration: GitHub is widely used for team-based development. Multiple developers can contribute to a project, create branches, propose changes, and collaborate seamlessly.
•	Project Management: GitHub provides tools for tracking issues, managing tasks, and organizing work through project boards.
4.	Interfaces:
•	Web Interface: GitHub primarily operates through a web interface, allowing users to interact with repositories using a browser.
•	Git Integration: Developers can still use Git commands locally and push/pull changes to and from GitHub.
Relationship:
•	Integration: GitHub integrates with Git. Developers use Git commands locally and interact with GitHub to collaborate and manage remote repositories.
•	Extension of Git: GitHub extends the capabilities of Git by providing a centralized platform for collaboration, project management, and additional tools.
In summary, Git is the version control system itself, allowing for local management of source code versions, while GitHub is a web-based platform that utilizes Git for version control and enhances collaboration through additional features.
